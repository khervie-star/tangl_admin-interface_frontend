            In the event of an interruption or cessation of our business, we

          </TermText>
          <TermTitle>How long do we keep personal data?</TermTitle>
          <TermText>
            We will only keep your personal data for so long as it is reasonable
            for us to do so, depending upon the nature of the data and our
            processing, and the grounds upon which we collected it. In general,
            we will delete redundant account information within 14 days of our
            relationship ending. However, we are obliged to keep certain records
            of our relationship to comply with the FCA’s rules, in which case we
            will instead restrict access through our archiving processes.
            Subject to any actual or potential legal claim, the maximum time
            that we envisage retaining any of your information is seven years,
            after which time it will be destroyed.
            <br /> Information we use for marketing purposes will be kept by us
            until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive this
            information. If you do notify us that you no longer wish to receive
            marketing information we will keep an encrypted version of your
            contact information to ensure we respect your wishes.
          </TermText>
          <TermTitle>What are your rights?</TermTitle>
          <TermText>
            You have the right to request information and access to the personal
            data we hold about you.
            <br /> You also have the right to request that we correct or delete
            any incomplete, incorrect, unnecessary or outdated personal data we
            hold on you. However, we cannot delete such personal data that is
            necessary for compliance, our binding legal obligations or if the
            personal data must be retained according to applicable laws, or is
            required for the exercise or defence of a legal claim.
            <br /> In case you consider your personal data collected by us to be
            inaccurate but you do not wish your personal data to be deleted; if
            we have used your personal data unlawfully; or you have objected to
            the processing and the existence of legitimate grounds for
            processing is still under consideration, you may request restriction
            of processing of your personal data.
            <br /> You may also at any time object to your personal data being
            processed for direct marketing purposes, sending promotional
            materials, profiling, or for the performance of market research.
            Further, where your personal data is processed based on your
            consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent for such
            processing at any time. <br />
            In case you wish to make use of your rights mentioned above, you
            may, as appropriate and in accordance with applicable laws, exercise
            such rights by contacting us through the contact points referred in
            the marketing materials or below in this Notice. In some cases,
            especially if you wish us to delete or cease the processing of your
            personal data, this may also mean that we may not be able to
            continue to provide the services to you. <br />
            Please note that we may need to identify you and to ask for
            additional information in order to be able to fulfil your above
            requests. Please also note that applicable law may contain
            restrictions and other provisions that relate to your above rights.
