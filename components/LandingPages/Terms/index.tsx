          <TermSubtitle>Fees and Process</TermSubtitle>
          <TermText>
            Issuers will upload an offer for Investors to invest in certain
            Securities up to a certain amount of the overall investment round
            (the “Allocation”). If you are an Investor, and you choose to invest
            in an Issuer’s Securities, you will be able to make a commitment to
            invest a certain amount on the Site which counts towards TANGL
            Capital Partners allocated amount available for the overall
            investment. If the Allocation is filled and the investment goes
            ahead, you will be irrevocably bound to invest this amount unless
            the terms of the investment change materially. TANGL Capital
            Partners may charge the Investor and the Issuer fees related to
            individual investments, including but not limited to an arrangement
            fee (a percentage of the amount of investment raised), a listing fee
            (a fixed price per offer of Securities), an annual management fee (a
            percentage of the amount invested) and success fees (a proportion of
            the financial gain on realisation of an Investment, howsoever
            structured). These fees will be determined on a case by case basis
            and clearly laid out on the Site. By committing to invest, you are
            deemed to have accepted these fees and are irrevocably bound to pay
            them on demand. TANGL Capital Partners will enter into a separate

          <TermSubtitle>Vulnerable Customers</TermSubtitle>
          <TermText>
            Vulnerable Customers In February 2015, the FCA published a Consumer
            Vulnerability Occasional Paper, in which a vulnerable customer was
            defined as: ‘…someone who due to their personal circumstances is
            especially susceptible to detriment particularly when a firm is not
            acting with appropriate levels of care.’ Customer vulnerability is
            defined as any personal, social or other factor(s) that may impact
            your ability to exercise informed decision making, rendering them
            vulnerable to suggestion and/or impacting your confidence to invest.
            Below we have outlined a broad range of circumstances and situations
            including, but not limited to: Illness/Sickness – This could be due
            to a short-term condition or something of a longer-term nature such
            as convalescing with medical conditions. Age – Our ever-aging
            population means that elderly people are increasingly more inclined
            to invest for their future. However, with age also comes certain
            age-related conditions which may impact your ability to invest
            confidently and appropriately. We would advise anyone over the age
            of 60 to contact us via email so we may assist with your application
            (see below). Physical Disability – The broad nature of disability
            encompasses a number of forms including but not limited to:
            deafness, blindness, and the restriction of limb use or mobility.
            All of which are factors which may impact your ability to invest
            through TANGL Capital Partners. Bereavement – Loss of a partner,
            relative or close friend may temporarily render you susceptible or
            vulnerable, something which may impact rational decision making.
            Mental Capacity – This applies to customers who may suffer from any
            form of mental incapacity, which again may impact your ability to
            invest. If you feel one of the above might be applicable, you should
            contact TANGL Capital Partners Ltd using the following email address
            and a member of the team will be able to assist you with your
            investment journey.
