              One-year horizon IRRs through Q3 2021 remained incredibly strong
              despite another wave of COVID-19 during the quarter that raised
              concerns about a pullback in performance. Returns to date indicate
              that the majority of private market funds have been able to pivot
              to handle pandemic-related challenges.

              Our latest Global Fund Performance Report uses data through Q3
              2021 as well as some preliminary Q4 figures to provide a
              comprehensive look at the returns of various fund strategies. We
              also examine why public market comparisons may lead to
              disappointing private markets performance in coming quarters.

                Private equity returns cooled in Q3 2021, dropping to 6.8% amid
                a quickly changing macroeconomic backdrop. That figure
                represents the strategyâ€™s lowest quarterly IRR since Q1 2020.

                Real estate hit a 17.2% one-year horizon IRR, its best one-year
                performance since 2014, with preliminary Q4 IRR suggesting a
                bright future for the asset class.

                Private debt performance waned drastically during the quarter,
                but still remains strong on an annual basis, though deceleration
                of these figures is anticipated in coming quarters

                Secondaries funds stepped up to a new level of fundraising in
                2020 and experienced a substantial uptick in performance during
                2021, notching a one-year horizon IRR of 52.5%.
